# JavaScript - Control Flow lab

## Timings

30 - 45 Minutes

## Summary

You've been given a bunch of variables, alerts and prompts that build up a story. Using what you've learned about control flow, it's up to you to write the conditional statements necessary to connect the alerts and prompts follow the story through to the end.

## Tasks

* Read the alerts carefully to ascertain which will continue the story and which will end it.
* Read the comments carefully to check which kind of conditional statement you'll have to write for each chapter.
* Write statements using the provided variables to meet the different conditions.

By the end of this lab you will have written:

  * A simple if/else statement to decide between two outcomes.
  * An if/else if/else statement to decide between two outcomes and then any other.
  * A switch statement with multiple cases and a default.

And have used the boolean operators for:
  * Equal to
  * Less than
  * Greater than
